# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

Rock-paper-scissors is a hand game that is played by two people. The players count to three in unison and simultaneously "throw" one of three hand signals that correspond to rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined by the rules:

+ Rock smashes scissors
+ Scissors cuts paper
+ Paper covers rock

Due to the fact that a tie happens around 1/3 of the time, several variants of Rock-paper-scissors exist that include more choices to make ties less likely. Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock (RPSLS) is one such variant that allows five choices. Each choice wins against two other choices, loses against two other choices, and ties against itself. The winner is determined by the rules:

+ Scissors cuts paper
+ Paper covers rock
+ Rock crushes lizard
+ Lizard poisons Spock
+ Spock smashes scissors
+ Scissors decapitates lizard
+ Lizard eats paper
+ Paper disproves Spock
+ Spock vaporizes rock
+ And as it always has been, rock crushes scissors
